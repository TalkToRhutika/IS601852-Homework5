### Logging
There are five built-in levels of the log message.  
- Debug: These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
- Info: These are used to confirm that things are working as expected
- Warning: These are used as an indication that something unexpected happened, or is indicative of some problem in the near future
- Error: This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function
- Critical: This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running
